	shows up to help on this task by trying to optimize the user information

	of this work is to present {OPENEDEYES}, a {JavaScript} framework
	that uses web standards to implement interactive information visualization
	modules to be run in a web browser. From the framework core, a case
	study was built based on a real dataset for an empiric framework
	evaluation. Traditional and new techniques were implemented confirming
	the flexibility and extensibility of the framework.},

  abstract = {Real-time transit tracking is gaining popularity as a means for transit
	agencies to improve the rider experience. However, many transit agencies
	lack either the funding or initiative to provide such tracking services.
	In this paper, we describe a crowd-sourced alternative to official
	transit tracking, which we call cooperative transit tracking. Participating
	users install an application on their smart-phone. With the help
	of built-in sensors, such as {GPS}, {WiFi}, and accelerometer, the
	application automatically detects when the user is riding in a transit
	vehicle. On these occasions (and only these), it sends periodic,
	anonymized, location updates to a central tracking server. Our technical
	contributions include (a) an accelerometer-based activity classification
	algorithm for determining whether or not the user is riding in a
	vehicle, (b) a memory and time-efficient route matching algorithm
	for determining whether the user is in a bus vs. another vehicle,
	(c) a method for tracking underground vehicles, and an evaluation
	of the above on real-world data. By simulating the Chicago transit
	network, we find that the proposed system would shorten expected
	wait times by 2 minutes with only 5\% of transit riders using the
	system. At a 20\% penetration level, the mean wait time is reduced
	from 9 to 3 minutes.},

  title = {{VTrack:} accurate, energy-aware road traffic delay estimation using

  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 7th {ACM} Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor
	Systems},

  pages = {85--98},
  abstract = {Traffic delays and congestion are a major source of inefficiency,
	wasted fuel, and commuter frustration. Measuring and localizing these
	delays, and routing users around them, is an important step towards
	reducing the time people spend stuck in traffic. As others have noted,
	the proliferation of commodity smartphones that can provide location
	estimates using a variety of sensors---{GPS}, {WiFi}, and/or cellular
	triangulation---opens up the attractive possibility of using position
	samples from drivers' phones to monitor traffic delays at a fine
	spatiotemporal granularity. This paper presents {VTrack}, a system
	for travel time estimation using this sensor data that addresses
	two key challenges: energy consumption and sensor unreliability.
	While {GPS} provides highly accurate location estimates, it has several
	limitations: some phones don't have {GPS} at all, the {GPS} sensor
	doesn't work in "urban canyons" (tall buildings and tunnels) or when
	the phone is inside a pocket, and the {GPS} on many phones is power-hungry
	and drains the battery quickly. In these cases, {VTrack} can use
	alternative, less energy-hungry but noisier sensors like {WiFi} to
	estimate both a user's trajectory and travel time along the route.
	{VTrack} uses a hidden Markov model ({HMM)-based} map matching scheme
	and travel time estimation method that interpolates sparse data to
	identify the most probable road segments driven by the user and to
	attribute travel times to those segments. We present experimental
	results from real drive data and {WiFi} access point sightings gathered
	from a deployment on several cars. We show that {VTrack} can tolerate
	significant noise and outages in these location estimates, and still
	successfully identify delay-prone segments, and provide accurate
	enough delays for delay-aware routing algorithms. We also study the
	best sampling strategies for {WiFi} and {GPS} sensors for different
	energy cost regimes.},
