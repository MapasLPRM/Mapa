	Abstract = {Extract knowledge from a dataset is not trivial. Information visualization shows up to help on this task by trying to optimize the user information gathering by using suitable graphical representations. There are some tools for this, but they are often focused on desktop, require advanced knowledge or use proprietary technologies. The proposal of this work is to present {OPENEDEYES}, a {JavaScript} framework that uses web standards to implement interactive information visualization modules to be run in a web browser. From the framework core, a case study was built based on a real dataset for an empiric framework evaluation. Traditional and new techniques were implemented confirming the flexibility and extensibility of the framework.},

@inproceedings{thiagarajan_vtrack:_2009,
	Abstract = {Traffic delays and congestion are a major source of inefficiency, wasted fuel, and commuter frustration. Measuring and localizing these delays, and routing users around them, is an important step towards reducing the time people spend stuck in traffic. As others have noted, the proliferation of commodity smartphones that can provide location estimates using a variety of sensors---{GPS}, {WiFi}, and/or cellular triangulation---opens up the attractive possibility of using position samples from drivers' phones to monitor traffic delays at a fine spatiotemporal granularity. This paper presents {VTrack}, a system for travel time estimation using this sensor data that addresses two key challenges: energy consumption and sensor unreliability. While {GPS} provides highly accurate location estimates, it has several limitations: some phones don't have {GPS} at all, the {GPS} sensor doesn't work in "urban canyons" (tall buildings and tunnels) or when the phone is inside a pocket, and the {GPS} on many phones is power-hungry and drains the battery quickly. In these cases, {VTrack} can use alternative, less energy-hungry but noisier sensors like {WiFi} to estimate both a user's trajectory and travel time along the route. {VTrack} uses a hidden Markov model ({HMM)-based} map matching scheme and travel time estimation method that interpolates sparse data to identify the most probable road segments driven by the user and to attribute travel times to those segments. We present experimental results from real drive data and {WiFi} access point sightings gathered from a deployment on several cars. We show that {VTrack} can tolerate significant noise and outages in these location estimates, and still successfully identify delay-prone segments, and provide accurate enough delays for delay-aware routing algorithms. We also study the best sampling strategies for {WiFi} and {GPS} sensors for different energy cost regimes.},

@inproceedings{thiagarajan_cooperative_2010,
	Abstract = {Real-time transit tracking is gaining popularity as a means for transit agencies to improve the rider experience. However, many transit agencies lack either the funding or initiative to provide such tracking services. In this paper, we describe a crowd-sourced alternative to official transit tracking, which we call cooperative transit tracking. Participating users install an application on their smart-phone. With the help of built-in sensors, such as {GPS}, {WiFi}, and accelerometer, the application automatically detects when the user is riding in a transit vehicle. On these occasions (and only these), it sends periodic, anonymized, location updates to a central tracking server. Our technical contributions include (a) an accelerometer-based activity classification algorithm for determining whether or not the user is riding in a vehicle, (b) a memory and time-efficient route matching algorithm for determining whether the user is in a bus vs. another vehicle, (c) a method for tracking underground vehicles, and an evaluation of the above on real-world data. By simulating the Chicago transit network, we find that the proposed system would shorten expected wait times by 2 minutes with only 5\% of transit riders using the system. At a 20\% penetration level, the mean wait time is reduced from 9 to 3 minutes.},
